Modify 1-params/merge_parameters.py so it reads all parameter files.

1-params/qoplsaa.lib
1-params/qoplsaa.prm

The two files above have been swapped out for opls2015 files that have different hydrogens atom names, thus I removed all the hydrogens from your pdb file.
2-structures/GPX6_cysM_no_hyd.pdb

Then you solvate in 3-solvate using qprep:
qprep < qprep.inp > qprep.out

Use the find_shit_hoh.py script to find bad waters. In your case I couldn't find any.
Also there are no crystal waters in your input pdb so make sure you aren't missing any important ones.

Then you make the final topology by going back to this the 1-prep directory and using the qprep.inp file there:
qprep < qprep.inp > qprep.out

Now you should have generated two files that you can use to run the simulations:
GPX6_cysM.top  GPX6_cysM_top.pdb

For the fep file you can look in the 4-fep_files directory. Make sure you are happy with the soft-pair and Morse parameters.
